# Project Configuration for Claude Code

> Drop this file in any project root. Customize the PROJECT CONFIG section.

## PROJECT CONFIG

```yaml
# === CUSTOMIZE THIS SECTION ===
project_name: "YOUR_PROJECT_NAME"
dev_server_cmd: "npm run dev"
dev_url: "http://localhost:3000"
tech_stack:
  - TypeScript
  - React
  - Node.js
test_flows:
  - "Homepage load"
  - "User authentication"
  - "Main feature flow"
# === END CUSTOMIZATION ===
```

## CORE RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### 1. No Unauthorized Changes
- **ASK BEFORE** modifying any file not directly related to the current task
- **NEVER** refactor "while you're in there"
- **NEVER** update dependencies unless explicitly requested
- **NEVER** change configuration files without explicit approval

### 2. Follow Existing Patterns
- Match the codebase's existing style exactly
- If unsure about a pattern, **grep for examples first**
- New code should be indistinguishable from existing code

### 3. Atomic Changes
- One logical change per commit
- If a task requires multiple changes, break them into steps
- Each step should leave the codebase in a working state

### 4. Verify Before Claiming Done
- Run the dev server after changes
- Check for TypeScript/lint errors
- Test the actual UI if it's a UI change

## AVAILABLE AGENTS (24)

| Browser QA (4) | browser-qa-agent, fullstack-qa-orchestrator, console-monitor, visual-diff |
| Deploy (2) | deploy-checker, env-validator |
| Utility (2) | pr-writer, seed-generator |
| Supervisor (1) | architect-reviewer |

## WORKFLOWS (6)

| Workflow | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| pre-commit | Run before commits |
| pre-deploy | Run before deployment |
| full-audit | All auditors in parallel |
| new-feature | TDD workflow |
| bug-fix | Regression prevention |
| release-prep | Release preparation |

## CHROME BROWSER QA

```bash
# Enable Chrome in Claude Code:
/chrome

# Verify:
/chrome status
```

## QUICK COMMANDS

```
# Workflows
"Run pre-commit workflow"
"Run full-audit workflow on src/"
"Run pre-deploy workflow"
"Run new-feature workflow for: [feature]"
"Run bug-fix workflow for: [bug]"
"Run release-prep workflow for v1.0.0"

# Parallel audit
"Run code-auditor, bug-auditor, security-auditor in parallel on src/"

# Browser QA
"Use fullstack-qa-orchestrator to test {dev_url}"
"Use browser-qa-agent to check for console errors"

# Pre-PR
"Use architect-reviewer to verify production-ready"
```

## COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL

### Starting a Task
1. State what you're going to do
2. List files you'll touch
3. Wait for confirmation if scope seems large

### Completing a Task
1. Summarize what was done
2. List files changed
3. Note any follow-up needed
4. Offer to run browser QA if UI was touched

## ERROR HANDLING

### If Build Fails
1. Read the full error message
2. Fix the specific error
3. Don't "clean up" unrelated code
4. Verify build passes before continuing

### If Tests Fail
1. Understand why the test failed
2. Determine if test or code is wrong
3. Fix the actual issue
4. Don't delete or skip tests

### If Browser QA Fails
1. Check console for specific errors
2. Identify the root cause
3. Fix in code, not with workarounds
4. Re-run browser QA to verify

## REMEMBER

- You're working in a real codebase with real users
- Breaking changes affect real people
- When in doubt, ask
- Quality over speed
