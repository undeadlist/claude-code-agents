# Project Configuration for Claude Code

> Drop this file in any project root. Customize the PROJECT CONFIG section.

## PROJECT CONFIG

```yaml
# === CUSTOMIZE THIS SECTION ===
project_name: "YOUR_PROJECT_NAME"
dev_server_cmd: "npm run dev"
dev_url: "http://localhost:3000"
tech_stack:
  - TypeScript
  - React
  - Node.js
test_flows:
  - "Homepage load"
  - "User authentication"
  - "Main feature flow"
# === END CUSTOMIZATION ===
```

## CORE RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### 1. No Unauthorized Changes
- **ASK BEFORE** modifying any file not directly related to the current task
- **NEVER** refactor "while you're in there"
- **NEVER** update dependencies unless explicitly requested
- **NEVER** change configuration files without explicit approval

### 2. Follow Existing Patterns
- Match the codebase's existing style exactly
- If unsure about a pattern, **grep for examples first**
- New code should be indistinguishable from existing code

### 3. Atomic Changes
- One logical change per commit
- If a task requires multiple changes, break them into steps
- Each step should leave the codebase in a working state

### 4. Verify Before Claiming Done
- Run the dev server after changes
- Check for TypeScript/lint errors
- Test the actual UI if it's a UI change

## CHROME BROWSER QA INTEGRATION

This project uses Claude's Chrome integration for UI testing.

### Setup
```bash
# In Claude Code, enable Chrome:
/chrome

# Verify connection:
/chrome status
```

### QA Commands
```
# Full QA scan:
"Use fullstack-qa-orchestrator to test {dev_url}"

# Quick browser check:
"Use browser-qa-agent to navigate to {dev_url} and check for console errors"

# Verify specific fix:
"Use browser-qa-agent to verify the login form now shows validation errors"
```

## COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL

### Starting a Task
1. State what you're going to do
2. List files you'll touch
3. Wait for confirmation if scope seems large

### During a Task
- Report significant decisions
- Ask if you hit ambiguity
- Don't go silent for extended operations

### Completing a Task
1. Summarize what was done
2. List files changed
3. Note any follow-up needed
4. Offer to run browser QA if UI was touched

## ERROR HANDLING

### If Build Fails
1. Read the full error message
2. Fix the specific error
3. Don't "clean up" unrelated code
4. Verify build passes before continuing

### If Tests Fail
1. Understand why the test failed
2. Determine if test or code is wrong
3. Fix the actual issue
4. Don't delete or skip tests

### If Browser QA Fails
1. Check console for specific errors
2. Identify the root cause
3. Fix in code, not with workarounds
4. Re-run browser QA to verify

## AGENT USAGE

### Parallel Audit (Fast)
```
"Run parallel audit: code-auditor on src/components/,
 bug-auditor on src/lib/, security-auditor on src/api/"
```

### Browser QA Loop (Thorough)
```
"Use fullstack-qa-orchestrator to find and fix UI issues at {dev_url}"
```

### Pre-PR Check
```
"Use architect-reviewer to verify changes are production-ready"
```

## REMEMBER

- You're working in a real codebase with real users
- Breaking changes affect real people
- When in doubt, ask
- Quality over speed
